# Sudoku Solver

This project is a Sudoku Solver built using backtracking and other algorithms. The program takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid as input and outputs the solved puzzle. It also includes a user-friendly interface for solving puzzles interactively.

## Features
- Solves standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles
- Validates the input grid for correctness
- Visualizes the solving process (optional feature)
- Can handle puzzles with varying levels of difficulty
- Includes a GUI for interactive use

## Algorithm
- Uses **Backtracking** as the primary technique:
  1. Find an empty cell.
  2. Attempt to fill the cell with digits (1â€“9).
  3. Check if the placement is valid.
  4. Recursively solve the rest of the grid.
  5. If a conflict arises, backtrack and try a different number.
- Optimized to minimize unnecessary computations:
  - Row, column, and sub-grid validation.
  - Early termination for invalid grids.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java
- Libraries for GUI (Swing for Java)
